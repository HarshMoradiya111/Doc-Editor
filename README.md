# Doc-Editor: A Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor

This is a full-stack, real-time collaborative document editor, inspired by Google Docs and Microsoft Word. It allows multiple users to join the same document and see each other's changes live as they type. This project was built as the final and most complex task for the Codtech internship program, integrating a modern frontend, a real-time backend, and a database for persistence.
